			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>My name is Michael Althoff and welcome to my website!  I am currently a Computer Science major at <a href = "http://unca.edu">University of North Carolina at Asheville</a>.   This site started as a project for a computer science class I was taking.</p>
            <p>As you may have noticed one of my interests is motorcycling.  This is mainly a place for sharing information I have acquired on track days and motorcycling for those new to the sport.</p>
                <h3><u>Have a look around</u></h3>
                <p>Take a look at the <a href = "trackdays.html">Track Day Information page</a> for a general overview of what track days are and what you need to do to get started. </p>
                <p>The <a href = "tdResource.html">Track Day Resource page</a> includes a list of some track day providers and several links to online retailers for motorcycle gear that I have used.</p>
                <p>The <a href = "youtube.html">YouTube</a> area has a some additional information for a track day beginner as well as a link to <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/user/jmoges">my YouTube channel.</a></p>
