			<h2>What is a Track Day?</h2>

			<p>Did you come here wondering what a track day was?  In short, a track day is one of the most fun things you can legally experience!  Track days are available to car drivers and motorcycle riders with only a few simple rules to follow to get you safely on track.  My experience is with motorcycles, but I will try to include both.  The procedures are basically the same for automobiles and motorcycles.</p>

            <p>A track day is meant to be unintimidating but most people are apprehensive to putting the time and resources into it.  You and a number of other fun-loving individuals share a closed race course to practice riding or driving at high speeds in a controlled environment.  This allows you to reach your personal limits and the mechanical limits of your vehicle.  Practicing cornering, braking, and accelerating at a track day allows you to be a safer rider or driver on the street.</p>
            <p>One of the most important things to do when showing up for a track day is to leave your ego at the gate.  It can be a dangerous activity and it's best to stay within your comfort zone for your safety and the safety of others on the track.  Speed will come with practice.</p>

			<p>What A Track Day Isn't:
                <ul>
                    <li>A track day is NOT a race, there is no competition</li>
                    <li>NOT a place to ride or drive recklessly</li>    
                </ul></p>
			<p>What A Track Day Is:
                <ul><li>A  great place to learn and have a ton of fun</li>
                    <li>A place to meet new people</li></ul></p>

			<h2><u>General Information</u></h2>
    
    <p>Yes, track days can be expensive, but they aren't as daunting as they seem at first glance.  I'm going to speak in terms of motorcycle track days from now on because that is what I have experience in, but car track days follow a lot of the same principles.</p>
    <p>There are track day providers all over the United States and you need to find out who you are going to ride with.  Look for tracks around your area and see who organizes track days there.  You can find some of these organizations on the <a href = "tdResource.html">Track Day Resources Page</a>.</p>
    <h2><u>Gear and Bike Preparation</u></h2>
    <p>If you're looking to get into doing trackdays you probably have the most expensive item already, your vehicle!  Hopefully you already have some of the other necessary protective equipment:</p>
    
    <ul><li>An undamaged full face helmet (not modular)</li>
        <li>Gauntlet gloves</li>
        <li>Motorcycle Boots</li>
        <li>Leathers (One or Two Piece)</li></ul>
    <p>Different organizations require different levels of equipment.  With some you can get away with just wearing over the ankle work boots (NOT recommended) while others will require a motorcycle specific race style boot.  Short gloves and 3/4 gloves are generally not acceptable.  You don't want any exposed skin in the event of a crash.</p>
<p>There are good deals on gear out there if you look and buying used is a good place to start as long as the gear isn't too damaged.  Look to the <a href = "tdResource.html">Track Day Resources Page</a> for more information on where to look.  <a href = "http://www.sportbiketrackgear.com">SportBike Track Gear</a> has also done some good videos breaking down pricing and features of different types of motorcycle gear.  Head over to the <a href = "youtube.html">Youtube page</a> if you're looking for a good comparison. </p>
    <h3><u>Preparation and At The Track</u></h3>
    <p>Make sure your bike is ready to pass technical inspection <b>before</b> you leave for the track.  Usually a few days ahead is a good idea in the event that you run into trouble.  Double check the tech inspection requirements for the organization you are riding with and the group you are riding in.  With everything complete ahead of time you won't have to scramble the morning of the track day and you can relax.</p>
    <p>When you arrive at the track (the night before or morning of) you are usually free to park and set up your pit wherever you want.  Feel free to talk to your neighbors, most track day riders are very friendly and helpful.  Set up your area and relax.</p>
    <p>Some items you may want to bring at a minimum are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Some shade, pop-up canopys are very popular</li>
        <li>Chairs</li>
        <li>Extra Cash - Concessions, if available, may not take cards</li>
        <li>Plenty of water and a cooler</li>     
    </ul>
    <p>It's a good idea to bring your own food.  Be aware of important times such as when registration opens and closes, when tech inspection opens and closes, and when the riders meeting is.  Stay hydrated throughout the day.  At the end of the day, if you aren't staying for the next day, pack up and head home making sure you pick up after yourself.  Head home tired and excited for your next track day!</p>
